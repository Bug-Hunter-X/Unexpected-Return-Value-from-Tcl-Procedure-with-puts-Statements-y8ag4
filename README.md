This repository contains a simple Tcl script demonstrating an unexpected behavior when using puts statements within a procedure. The script defines a procedure 'badproc' which takes two arguments, prints their values using puts, and then returns their sum.  However, due to the way Tcl handles command substitution, the returned value is not what one might expect. The solution demonstrates how to modify the procedure to return the correct numerical sum.
